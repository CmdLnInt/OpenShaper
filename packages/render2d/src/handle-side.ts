 * pane: the "left" handle is then below and the "right" one above. Rather than
 * thread the orientation into every label, name the handles by the thing they point
 * at — a board's tail and nose do not move when the pane does, and it is the
 * language a shaper would use anyway.
 *
 * Cross-sections keep left/right: they travel out from the centreline and back, so
 * neither end is nearer the nose, and they are never turned (a section is already
 * the shape of its pane). Their side is still resolved from the handles' actual
 * horizontal positions by {@link handleKindForVisualSide}.
