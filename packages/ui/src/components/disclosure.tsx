 * composes it rather than replacing it, so a panel that should never collapse (the
 * view panes) keeps using `Panel` directly.
 *
 * The body is **unmounted** while closed, not hidden. Several sidebar sections hold
 * `useSyncExternalStore` subscriptions to the board store, and a hidden subtree keeps
 * subscribing and re-rendering on every drag of a control point — which is exactly the
 * work the project's "UI never blocks" rule exists to avoid. The cost is that transient
 * local state inside a section does not survive a collapse; nothing in the sidebar keeps
 * anything there worth more than the re-render budget.
